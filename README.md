# Weekly Playlist

## Overview
A playlist is a list of songs or pieces of music. It's a word that started out in radio stations - the 'playlist' was all the tracks that were to be played that day on the show. A playlist can be unique to you with all your favourite songs and can be shared with friends where they can also share theirs and update the playlist.
Weekly Playlist has been created for users to view and add songs to the playlist everytime they access the app. This playlist consists pre-set songs already ready to be viewed and obtained. Through different routes the user takes, they can can view these songs to provide them new songs to share with friends or play at parties. Another route they can take is to also add songs to the playlist and keep increasing the number of songs in the playlist. At the end of each option, the user have the option to go back to the main menu and re-choose again or exit the program.
